This box model is a replica of the collision box for the foot of the iCub.

Can be used along with ApplyExternalWrenchPlugin in the test/ContactModels 
branch of gazebo_yarp_plugins to test the contact model for the foot under the
exposure to the external forces.

forcescope.xml is used to visualize the forces acting on the box.
